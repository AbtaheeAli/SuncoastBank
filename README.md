# SuncoastBank

I created a personal bank account manager. This application allows the user to track both a savings and checking account total by performing transactions, such as withdrawals, deposits, and transfers. The application also saves any information inputted by the user in a CSV file.

Details about the Application:

- At start-up, the application loads past transactions from the CSV file
- The balances in savings and checking account are displayed when the program first starts
- The program will not allow the user to withdraw more money than allowed. That is, the user cannot allow the accounts to go negative
- When user is prompted for an amount to deposit or withdraw, the amount must be positive

After balances have been displayed, the application displays a menu:

- View account balances
- Deposit funds into checking or savings account
- Withdraw funds into checking or savings account
- Quit the application
